# Order_Sales_analysis_of_Amazon

To perform an order sales analysis of Amazon using Power BI, you can follow these steps:

1)Connect to your Amazon data. You can do this using the Amazon Marketplace Web Service (MWS) connector. Once you have connected to your data, Power BI will import it into a dataset.
2)Clean and transform your data. You may need to clean and transform your data before you can start analyzing it. For example, you may need to remove empty rows, convert data types, or merge datasets.
3)Create measures and dimensions. Measures are the quantitative values that you want to analyze, such as order amount, order quantity, and average order value. Dimensions are the qualitative categories that you want to group your data by, such as product category, customer type, and order date.
4)Create visualizations. Power BI offers a variety of visualizations that you can use to analyze your data. Some common visualizations for order sales analysis include bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.
5)Build a dashboard. A dashboard is a collection of visualizations that you can use to monitor your key performance indicators (KPIs) and track your progress over time.
